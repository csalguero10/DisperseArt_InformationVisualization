## When Culture Becomes a Target  
### Destruction, looting, and cultural appropriation in Ukraine across history and war  

This repository contains the final project developed for the course  
[Information Visualization](https://www.unibo.it/en/study/course-units-transferable-skills-moocs/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2023/467047)  
(academic year 2023/2024, DhDk – University of Bologna).

The project investigates patterns of cultural destruction, looting, and long-term cultural appropriation in Ukraine through the integration and visualization of institutional datasets.  
Using a data-driven approach, the website explores how different forms of cultural harm unfold across time, space, and political contexts.
